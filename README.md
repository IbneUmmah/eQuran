## Inspirations

A lot of Islamic Apps are available on the internet today but most of 
them show Ads (Ads are not Islamic according to many Muslim scholars),
and sometime they sell their user data to bad people (like MuslimPro once sold their data to Uncle Sam Military).

- I want to create an app which is best among all and doesn't reveal their user data to anybody.
-To make some of above goals possibles, is to NOT GET USER DATA, which is done in this app.

- All the user bookmarks, prayer timing according to their cities never left the app.

## Roadmap

- Write a good and meaningful Roadmap

- Search Feature throughout the app

- Tajweed Feature

- Remember user prayer progress and notify if he/she is lagging

- and so on.
